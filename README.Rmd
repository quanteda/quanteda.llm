The **quanteda.llm** package makes it easy to use LLMs with quanteda.corpora (or data frames), to enable classification, summarisation, scoring, and analysis of documents and text. **quanteda** provides a host of convenient functions for managing, manipulating, and describing corpora as well as linking their document variables and metadata to these documents.  **quanteda.llm** makes it convenient to link these to LLMs for analysing or classifying these texts, creating new variables from what is created by the LLMs. Using a tidy approach and linking to the new **quanteda.tidy** package, we enable convenient operations using common Tidyverse functions for manipulating LLM-created obejcts and variables.

# Included functions

The package includes the following functions:

- `ai_summarize`: Summarizes documents in a corpus using an LLM
- `ai_qual`: Analyses documents in a corpus using an LLM and based on given instructions (simulating qualitative assessments)
- `ai_quant`: Scores documents in a corpus using an LLM and based on given instructions

More to follow.

# Supported LLMs

The package supports the following LLMs:

- **Ollama models**: To use the **quanteda.llm** functions first download and install [Ollama](https://ollama.com/). Then install some models either from the command line (e.g. with ollama pull llama3.2) or within R using the `rollama` R package. The Ollama app must be running for the models to be used.

- More to follow.

## Installation

You can install the development version of quanteda.llm from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("quanteda/quanteda.llm")
```

## Examples

### Using `ai_summarize`
```{.r}
library(quanteda.llm)
ai_summary <- ai_summarize(corpus_split, "splits", "llama3.2", 100)
ai_summary[5,5]
# A tibble: 1 × 1
#  summary                                                                                                                    
#  <chr>

### Using `ai_qual`
```{.r}
library(quanteda.llm)
result <- ai_qual(corpus_split, "splits", "llama3.2", 
                      prompt = "Is this text leaning towards the political left? The political left defined as groups which advocate for social equality, government intervention in the economy, and progressive policies.")
result[3,4]
# A tibble: 1 × 1
#  assess                                                                                                                                                         
#  <chr>

```

### Using `ai_quant`
```{.r}
library(quanteda.llm)
result <- ai_quant(corpus_split, 
                        "splits", 
                        "llama3.2", 
                        concept = "The political left defined as groups which advocate for social equality, government intervention in the economy, and progressive policies.")
head(result)
