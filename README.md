# quanteda.llm

<!-- badges: start -->

<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of **quanteda.llm** is to make it easy to use LLMs with
quanteda.corpora, to enable classification, summarisation, scoring, and
analysis of documents and text. **quanteda** provides a host of
convenient functions for managing, manipulating, and describing corpora
as well as linking their document variables and metadata to these
documents. **quanteda.llm** makes it convenient to link these to LLMs
for analysing or classifying these texts, creating new variables from
what is created by the LLMs. Using a tidy approach and linking to the
new **quanteda.tidy** package, we enable convenient operations using
common Tidyverse functions for manipulating LLM-created obejcts and
variables.
